# simple-calculator
A calculator that I'm proud of. It uses basic operators but it does the job well.

INSTRUCTIONS

Enter two numbers using option [5] before performing calculations.
Choose an operation:
  [1] Add → Adds the two numbers.
  [2] Subtract → Subtracts the second number from the first.
  [3] Multiply → Multiplies the two numbers.
  [4] Divide → Divides the first number by the second.
Division by zero is not allowed. You will be prompted to enter a valid number if necessary.
The result of each operation is stored as the first operand for further calculations.
After performing an operation, press Enter to return to the menu.
  Use [5] to enter new numbers at any time.
  Use [6] to view these instructions again.
  Use [7] to exit the program.
